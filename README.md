# Draft Notes 📓✍️

This repository contains notes, experiments, and workflows shared in **Draft Notes**, a series of one-off letters where I dig into engineering hacks, automation tricks, and real-world experiments.

Each issue is published as a newsletter but the raw notes, YAML workflows, and extra context live here for anyone who wants to dig deeper.

## 📬 What is Draft Notes?
Draft Notes is a side-channel of my main newsletter *The Draft*.  
It is where I share:
- 🛠 Experiments in GitHub Actions, automation, and AI tooling  
- 💡 Half-baked ideas that might save you time (or at least spark debate)  
- 🔍 Notes and workflows that are too detailed or messy for the main feed  

---

## 🔎 Why a Repo?
By keeping these notes in a public repo:
- Others can explore and reuse the workflows directly  
- Readers can track changes over time  
- It serves as a living archive beyond the newsletter  

---

## 🚀 How to Use
- Browse the repo to read past notes and code samples  
- Copy/paste workflows or scripts into your own projects  
- Watch the repo to get updates when new notes drop
