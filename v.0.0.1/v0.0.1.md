# Draft Notes v0.0.1: Auto-Generated PR Descriptions 🤖

🌟 **Editor’s Note**

Welcome to the first issue of **Draft Notes**. This is where I drop experiments, messy workflows, and ideas that might actually make your engineering life easier. This week I am taking on one of the laziest sins in engineering: blank PR descriptions. You know who you are.

---

😤 **The Problem: Empty PRs are Criminal**

Every team has *that* co-worker. The one who writes one-word commit messages, sometimes just a letter, and then opens a pull request with no description at all. These days that is unacceptable. GitHub gives you an auto-generate button if you are using Copilot. Leaving it blank is just lazy.

Even worse: repos that already have a PR template with sections for links, test runs, or screenshots. Seeing those left empty is painful. Context matters. A PR is like a book. Sure, you will still read the code, but the description is the summary that sets the stage.

---

⚡ **The Experiment: Auto-Describe with GitHub Models**

Since GitHub Models are free, I built a GitHub Actions workflow that creates a PR description the moment a PR is opened or updated.

What it does:
- 📝 Extracts links and screenshots already in the PR body so nothing is lost
- 🗂 Builds a compact PR context (commit subjects, files added and removed, directory churn)
- 🔍 Flags tests, config, and docs changes for the summary
- ⚖️ Keeps size under token limits by trimming hunks intelligently
- 🤖 Passes everything into the `actions/ai-inference` step with a clean template

The result: a consistent, usable PR description every time.

🛠 **Coding Corner: Why Compact Context**

I first tried passing the full git diff, which produced amazing descriptions, but it hit token limits fast. After testing, I settled on a compact context that captures enough signal without flooding the model: commit subjects, file churn, hunk headers, and simple detectors for tests, config, and docs.

          You are a release-notes assistant. Use ONLY the compact context below and produce a PR description.

          RULES:
          - In **Summary**, mention the overall intent using commit subjects if present, and cite at least **2 exact filenames** verbatim.
          - Prefer component names from **Components touched (dirstat)**.
          - Call out notable functions or methods if present in **Hunk symbols**.
          - If a file shows large churn in **Files (adds and deletes)**, note it briefly.
          - Populate a section **only if there is clear evidence**:
            - **Added**: status A or commit subjects say "add...".
            - **Removed**: status D or commit subjects say "remove..." or "delete...".
            - **Fixed**: commit subjects say "fix" or "bug" or "patch" or hunks indicate an obvious bugfix.
            - **Changed**: default bucket for edits when none of the above apply.
          - If only docs, config, or workflows changed (see **Docs touched** and **Config, workflows, and dependencies touched**), frame as maintenance.
          - If **Breaking change hints** exist, include a one line **⚠️ Breaking** note.
          - Do not invent items. Omit empty sections.
          - Keep bullets concise (no more than one line each). Never paste raw patches.

          ## ✨ Summary
          (2 to 4 sentences: what and why; mention 1 to 2 components and 2 or more filenames)

          ## 🔄 Changes
          - **Added**:
          - **Changed**:
          - **Fixed**:
          - **Removed**:

          ## 🧪 Testing
          (Mention tests touched if any; otherwise one line on how to validate)

          ## 📎 Links
          (issues or PRs or docs; else blank)

💡 **Tips**

- Keep the compact context file below 30 KB. Most repos will be fine with that.
- If your team relies on a specific template section, bias your prompt to call it out.

📎 **Takeaway**

This is a solid baseline. I am constantly tweaking it to see just how much context I can squeeze in without running into token limits, but even in its current form the automation ensures you never lose the basics. You can always layer more detail on top.
